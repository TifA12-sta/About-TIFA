            <h3>Why I joined HCSE ?</h3>
            <p>I decided to join HCSE for a variety of reasons. At first, the name caught my attention and the concept of being a "hacker" sounded exciting. What really interested me, though, were the Competitive Programming (CP) and app development tracks. I picked the CP track because I wanted to compete in events like ECPC and EOI. I find solving problems with C++ and algorithms both challenging and rewarding.</p>
            <h3>How I became a mentor ?</h3>
            <p>I consistently attended the CP track meetings and put in significant effort to tackle the assignments, even though I wasn't the top problem solver among the mentees since it was my first experience learning these concepts. Nevertheless, when the annual HCSE bootcamp arrived, I was selected as one of the best members and given the opportunity to be a mentor.</p>
            <h3> <a href="TIFA.html"> You guess this </a></h3>
            <p>After the season ended, the management board began searching for new leadership. When applications opened, I decided to apply for president because I had a clear vision for the club and believed I could address some of the challenges from the previous season. I was confident that I could make a positive impact. Thankfully, I passed the interview and was selected as president, joined by two outstanding vice presidents and a dedicated team of mentors.</p>
            <h3>How we started the new season ? A workshop!</h3>
            <div> 
                <h4> The workshop </h4>
                <p>We launched the new season with an exciting boba workshop, where participants created static websites using HTML and CSS. With more than 75 approved submissions, it became one of the biggest workshops ever held by the hack club.</p>

                <h4> The pizza party</h4> 
                <p>Fortunately, we were able to hold the workshop during Ramadan, the month when Muslims fast. To celebrate, we organized a great pizza party at sunset on the school football field.</p>
