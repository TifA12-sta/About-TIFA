            I haven't created many websites before, so I thought it would be interesting to introduce myself here.
            I'll also use this site to share some of my experiences with Hack Club.

        <p>
            I am <span class="tifa" onclick="document.getElementById('pronun').play()"> Mostafa Mohammad</span>, aka TIFA. I am a 17 years old student from Egypt.
            I heard about programmign when I was a kid but I didn't have a suitable laptop or PC to start learning. What's more important that I didn't have the consciousness that I should start doing other activities besides studying. 
        </p> 
        <h3> How my journey with programming started ? </h3>
        <p>
            I had the chance to join STEM High School for Boys - 6 th of October, the best high school in Egypt. There, I met a manny students who were interested in programming and technology.
            At the end of the first semester, the application for the <a href="https://stemegypt.hackclub.com/"> Hack Club of STEM Egypt </a> (HCSE) was opened. I was attractred to the idea of joining a club that is related to technology and programming. I applied and got accepted.
            This is the point where my journey started. 
            I will talk about that in the next <a href="stem.html"> page</a>
